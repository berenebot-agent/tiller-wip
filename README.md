<p align="center">
  <strong>One endpoint. One key per client. Steer the models behind it.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  A lightweight, self-hosted LLM router with a control panel built for people who actually change models.
</p>

> **Beta software.** Tiller Router is in a public beta. The routing core and deployment model are approaching stability, but the API and supported-provider surface may still evolve before a stable `1.0`. Feedback is welcomed but use with caution.

---

## Why Tiller exists

1. **Every tool had its own (bad) model selector.** Some bury it in settings, some want model IDs in config files, some barely support changing models at all. Tiller moves model selection out of the tool and into one control panel — change it without touching the clients.
2. **Cheap and free API access is useful — until it rate-limits.** Tiller gives virtual models an **ordered fallback chain**, so a limited provider is useful without becoming a single point of failure.
3. **Provider API keys were scattered everywhere.** Enter provider credentials once in Tiller; clients only ever receive a Tiller key.

---

## What Tiller does

Tiller sits between your LLM clients and your upstream providers. Clients keep a stable **endpoint, API key and model name**. You change what sits behind it — a route change applies to new requests immediately. Regardless of what model the client requests, Tiller sends the request to your selected model and the client need know no difference. No restart, no CLI, no config editing. Steer a client key from the control panel by picking any real or virtual model:

<p align="center">

</p>

> **Tiller does not try to choose the model for you. It gives you the tiller.**

---

## Client keys

Two client key types cover the two ways tools talk to an LLM API:

### Single — one key, one route

Exposes one stable model identity — usually something simple like `main` — bound to any real or virtual model. The key itself defines the route; and whichever model the client requests will be routed to thed provider and model you select in Tiller. Change the route from the web interface and the next request follows it.

### Catalogue — a controlled model list

Exposes a controlled subset of Tiller's catalogue through `GET /v1/models`, with per-client model permissions. Useful to curate exactly which providers and models appear for a client to save wading through hundreds of rows of models you don't use.

Capability metadata is informational: `/v1/models` includes `context_length` and `max_output_tokens` only when Tiller knows them, and a virtual model omits them when any eligible target is unknown. Clients do not necessarily consume these fields automatically; for example, an OpenCode custom-provider model ID under Tiller does not inherit limits from a same-named built-in provider entry, so OpenCode can report unknown context even when Tiller publishes the values.

---

## Virtual models

A virtual model gives a stable client-facing identity to one or more upstream targets. For example, `main/coding` might resolve to:

```text
1. Z.ai / GLM
2. DeepSeek
3. OpenRouter / Claude
```

The client only knows `main/coding`. You can reorder or replace the targets without changing the client.

Configure the ordered target list in the control panel:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/media/screenshots/auto_fallback.png" width="420" alt="Editing a virtual model's ordered fallback list">
</p>

**Ordered fallback:** if an upstream attempt fails before client-visible output begins, Tiller may try the next configured target — the order you configure is the order Tiller uses.

Each attempt is visible in Activity, including the fallback — the client gets a valid response and never knows there was a failure:

## Features

- **Steering** — fast web control panel; single and catalogue client keys; real and virtual models in one route selector; immediate route changes; stable client-facing identities.
- **Providers & models** — credentials entered once, use across your tools.
- **Routing** — fixed virtual routes; ordered fallback; configurable fallback timeout.
- **Client API** — `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/responses`, `POST /v1/messages`, covering the common OpenAI and Anthropic surfaces with safe protocol translation.
- **Activity** — searchable, filterable, CSV-exportable request metadata (client, model, route, provider, status, latency, tokens, fallbacks).
- **Notifications** — optional webhooks for fallback, all-targets-failed, key created/deleted, admin login.

---

## Supported providers

Tiller includes adapters for a broad set of native and OpenAI-compatible providers.

<details>
<summary><strong>Current provider types</strong></summary>

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- OpenRouter
- DeepSeek
- Z.ai / GLM
- Google Gemini API
- Azure OpenAI
- Amazon Bedrock API key

## Install

### Option 1 — Prebuilt image (recommended)

1. **Prepare a directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir tiller-router && cd tiller-router
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   services:
     tiller-router:
       container_name: tiller-router
       image: ghcr.io/dellarb/tiller-router:latest
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
       environment:
         TILLER_USERNAME: admin
         TILLER_PASSWORD: replace-this-with-a-long-random-password
       volumes:
         - ./data:/data
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

   

3. **Start Tiller:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:8080` and log in. For remote access, put Tiller behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and add environment variable TILLER_TRUSTED_PROXY=IP-OF-YOUR-PROXY. Hosted mode is opt-in with `TILLER_MODE=hosted`, `TILLER_PUBLIC_URL=https://app.example.com`, and separate `TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` credentials. Existing local installs may additionally provide their `TILLER_USERNAME` / `TILLER_PASSWORD` (or the deprecated `TILLER_ADMIN_*` aliases) once to migrate the local account into a verified hosted customer; hosted startup hard-fails instead of abandoning an existing local account when those migration credentials are missing or invalid. Fresh hosted installs do not create a customer automatically. The platform console is at `/platform` and customer login is at `/login`.

> **Renamed credential vars:** `TILLER_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `TILLER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are now `TILLER_USERNAME` / `TILLER_PASSWORD`, to deconflict with the hosted platform console's `TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_*`. The old names still work and log a startup deprecation warning; the new names win if both are set.

> **Reverse proxy + live UI:** the admin UI keeps its status icons and usage counters live over a Server-Sent Events stream at `/api/admin/live`. If you front Tiller with a reverse proxy, disable response buffering for that path (e.g. nginx `proxy_buffering off;` or Caddy's equivalent) and keep the proxy's read timeout above the stream's 5s heartbeat, or the stream will stall.

### Option 2 — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dellarb/tiller-router.git
cd tiller-router
cp .env.example .env   # set TILLER_USERNAME / TILLER_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d --build
```

The repository's `docker-compose.yml` builds locally instead of pulling an image; everything else (healthcheck, adoption-first posture, volumes) is identical to the prebuilt option above.

The service starts as root to self-fix `./data` ownership, then drops to a non-root user before serving.

### Hosted Compose networking

The main `docker-compose.yml` remains the simple self-hosted appliance: it
keeps direct `TILLER_PORT` publishing and does not require a reverse proxy.
Hosted deployments use the separate `docker-compose.hosted.yml` override:

```bash
TILLER_PUBLIC_URL=https://app.example.com TILLER_TRUSTED_PROXY=172.20.0.2/32 \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.hosted.yml up -d --build
```

Set the required platform admin credentials in `.env` as well. Choose the
trusted proxy IP/CIDR from the router's ingress network; don't trust the entire
network unless every host on it is a controlled reverse proxy.

The hosted override removes direct host-port publishing and attaches Tiller to
a managed `tiller-router-egress` network containing only Tiller, plus an
ingress network for the reverse proxy. It does not use the implicit Compose
default network.

If the reverse proxy runs in a different Compose project, point the hosted
override at its existing Docker network:

```dotenv
TILLER_INGRESS_NETWORK=proxy_network
TILLER_INGRESS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL=true
```

The hosted deployment requires `TILLER_PUBLIC_URL` and
`TILLER_TRUSTED_PROXY`, set to the direct reverse proxy's IP/CIDR so client IP
rate limits and audit records use the real client address. It still uses the
application-level `SafeTransport` for public HTTPS
destination validation and SSRF protection. Docker network isolation is only
defense in depth; it is not a substitute for the application policy or an
optional VPS firewall hardening rule.

### Hosted Google sign-in and Turnstile

Configure customer sign-in from **`/platform` → Signup and mail** after the
hosted service is running. These integrations are off until enabled there, and
their secrets are encrypted at rest with the platform settings.

For Google sign-in, create an OAuth client for a web application in Google
Cloud. Add the redirect URI displayed beside the client ID field in the
platform dashboard; it is the exact URL
`https://<your-hostname>/api/auth/google/callback`. Enter the OAuth client ID
and secret, then enable Google sign-in. Google supplies the verified email and
stable subject identifier. A Google email that already belongs to a Tiller
account is never linked automatically: sign in to that account and link Google
from **Settings → Account**.

For bot protection, create a Cloudflare Turnstile widget and allow your hosted
hostname in its widget settings. Enter its site key and secret key in the
platform dashboard, then enable Turnstile. The site key is public; the secret
is kept server-side. Turnstile protects signup, verification resend, password
reset requests, and the start of Google sign-in. Password login keeps its
existing rate limits. Turnstile works without routing the site through
Cloudflare. See the [Google web-server OAuth guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server)
and [Cloudflare Turnstile setup guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/).

The Google OAuth client secret and Turnstile secret key are encrypted at rest.
The browser receives neither secret. If you rotate a secret, enter the new
value and save; leave it blank to keep the stored value. Use the explicit
“Clear saved … secret” checkbox to remove one.

### Other compose / env options

The repo's `docker-compose.yml` plus `.env` cover the most common local
customisations without editing any Go code. The full list of local variables is
in `.env.example`. The hosted override additionally requires the platform
credentials below. `TILLER_USERNAME` / `TILLER_PASSWORD` (or the deprecated
`TILLER_ADMIN_*` aliases) are only needed there when converting an existing
local installation:

```bash
TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_USERNAME=platform-admin        # /platform username
TILLER_PLATFORM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-random-password
TILLER_TRUSTED_PROXY=172.20.0.2/32                   # required hosted: direct reverse proxy IP/CIDR
TILLER_USERNAME=owner@example.com                     # optional one-time migration input
TILLER_PASSWORD=existing-local-password               # optional one-time migration input
TILLER_PORT=8080                                     # host port (default 8080)
TILLER_RUN_UID=1000                                  # runtime uid (default 65532)
TILLER_RUN_GID=1000                                  # runtime gid (default 65532)
TILLER_UID=1000                                      # build-time uid for baked-in files (default 65532)
TILLER_GID=1000                                      # build-time gid for baked-in files (default 65532)
TILLER_MODELS_DEV_ENABLED=true                       # models.dev metadata (default true)
TILLER_ADMIN_SESSION_TTL=720h                        # admin session lifetime (default 720h)
TILLER_ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE=true                     # force Secure on the admin cookie (auto set to true if https used)
TILLER_PUBLIC_URL=https://app.example.com             # required by hosted override
TILLER_INGRESS_NETWORK=proxy_network                 # optional external proxy network
TILLER_INGRESS_NETWORK_EXTERNAL=true                 # set only for a pre-existing network
```

### First steps

1. **Add a provider** — in **Providers**, `+ Add provider`. Choose the type, name the instance, add its API credential. Tiller discovers the model catalogue where supported.

2. **Create a client key** — for the simplest setup: `Type: Single`, `Client model: main`, `Route: main/coding`. Tiller shows the client secret once.

3. **OPTIONAL*** - Create a virtual model - if you want to map different model names or have a fallback chain in case of failure.

4. **Point your tool at Tiller** — for an OpenAI-compatible client: `Base URL: http://localhost:8080/v1`, `API key: <your Tiller client key>`, `Model: main`.

Now steer the real route from Tiller instead of changing the client.

---

## API example

```bash
# List the models visible to a client key
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TILLER_API_KEY"

# Send a Chat Completions request
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TILLER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "main",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Say hello from whichever model Tiller is currently pointing at."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

With a Single key, `main` can be redirected from the control panel without changing this request.

---

## Design principles

- **Steerable over clever** — if you configure `A → B → C`, Tiller won't decide it prefers `C → A → B` based on an opaque score.
- **Stable clients, movable backends** — the client should know as little as possible about the real provider arrangement.
- **Failure should be boring** — a rate-limited upstream falls through to the next target without turning into an emergency reconfiguration.
- **Keep infrastructure small** — Go, SQLite, one container, few dependencies.
- **Don't collect content you don't need** — Activity answers "what route did this request take?", not "what did it say?". Activity is metadata-only by default. If the administrator explicitly enables Detailed Error Logging, failed request bodies and provider error bodies may be stored, bounded to 1 MiB, and Activity exports containing those records must be treated as sensitive.

---

## Data and security

Tiller stores its state under the configured data directory, normally `./data`. This includes sensitive provider credential material. Core configuration lives in `tiller-router.db` (self-hosted SQLite); high-churn Activity telemetry lives separately in `activity.db` and is disposable — losing it does not affect routing or configuration. Back up `tiller-router.db` (and the master key); `activity.db` can be backed up separately only if Activity history matters. Hosted Tiller is intended to move to PostgreSQL; ordinary self-hosting never requires an external database.

**Recoverable provider credentials are encrypted at rest, always on.** Provider API credentials, OAuth tokens, and the notification auth header are sealed with AES-256-GCM; the master key lives outside the database (`TILLER_MASTER_KEY` / `TILLER_MASTER_KEY_FILE`, or a generated `./data/master.key`). **Back the master key up separately** — without it, existing encrypted credentials cannot be recovered. A database backup does not contain the key; a full `./data` archive does, and must be treated as secret. If encrypted values exist but the key is missing or wrong, Tiller starts in a locked state and credential-bearing providers stay unavailable until the key is restored. Rotate with `tiller-router rotate-master-key` (service stopped). Take care with **where you store `./data`** and any backups of it — keep them on storage you trust.

Client API-key secrets are shown once and stored in hashed form for authentication. Activity is metadata-only by default. If you explicitly enable Detailed Error Logging, failed request bodies and provider error bodies may be stored, bounded to 1 MiB, and Activity exports containing those records must be treated as sensitive.

For anything other than local-only use: use HTTPS, put Tiller behind a trusted reverse proxy, use a strong admin password, protect the data directory and exported backups, and do not expose the control panel casually to the public internet. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Container posture — hardening is opt-in.** Out of the box the container already runs with a read-only rootfs, a scratch `/tmp` tmpfs, and `no-new-privileges`: it starts as root at boot, self-fixes `./data` ownership, drops to the runtime user, and serves. For internet-exposed deployments you can go further by adding `cap_drop: [ALL]` and forcing a strict non-root `user:` — the repository's `docker-compose.yml` shows the exact commented block. Two rules: `cap_drop ALL` removes the capabilities the boot-time ownership fix needs, so it requires `user:` alongside it; and with `user:` set, the ownership fix is skipped, so `./data` must already exist owned by that user (otherwise startup fails with a logged remediation telling you the expected owner).

---

## Development

Tiller is written in Go with an embedded browser UI and SQLite.

```bash
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./cmd/tiller-router
docker compose build
```

The project currently targets the Go version declared in `go.mod`.

---

## Project status

Tiller Router is in **beta**. The routing model is intentionally narrow and already useful, but the public API, migrations and provider compatibility surface may still evolve before a stable `1.0`. The near-term priority is reliability and hardening.

Likely post-beta areas include: additional provider validation, richer provider health, cost-aware routing, additional capability metadata, experimental subscription-backed providers such as Codex, and further hardening and operational polish.

---

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. The project intentionally favours a small, understandable core — new features are most useful when they strengthen Tiller's central job:
