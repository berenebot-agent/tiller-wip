# tests/scripts/prune-test-logs.sh — bound tests/logs/ via LRU (mtime) pruning.
#
# The containerised test runners emit per-run artifacts under tests/logs/:
# browser runs leave a tiller-browser-<pid>/ directory (~6MB, mostly an
# extracted fixturectl binary), compat leaves a dated .log, and the Go wrapper
# leaves a dated .log per invocation. Killed/interrupted runs (ssh drop, OOM,
# kill -9 while the EXIT trap is pending) pile up and there is no bound.
#
# Sourced by the browser and compatibility runners (each with its own per-glob
# cap) to bound their own artifacts. tests/run.sh no longer prunes its `runs/`
# tree automatically — runs are retained in full there, and reclaimed only when
# the human runs `./tests/run.sh --prune --keep N`, which sets every cap to N.
#
# Keep the N most recently modified entries per glob, remove the rest. It is
# deliberately mtime-based (LRU), not count-based on any per-test logic, so a
# preserved failed-run artifact is kept if recent and only evicted once it
# becomes the oldest.
#
# Never touches:
#   - tests/logs/history.tsv   (append-only ledger)
#   - tests/logs/latest        (symlink pointer)
#
# Browser run dirs may contain activity-data/ subdirs chowned by the router
# (running as uid 65532), so a plain `rm -rf` on the host fails. Evictions are
# cleared via a throwaway root container over the whole tests/logs tree — the
# same pattern the browser runner's own cleanup uses — so the prune cannot
# leave a half-removed tree behind.
#
# Source (`.`) this from a runner; or invoke it directly as a script. In the
# direct form, pass an optional cap as $1, defaulting to KEEP_BROWSER.
